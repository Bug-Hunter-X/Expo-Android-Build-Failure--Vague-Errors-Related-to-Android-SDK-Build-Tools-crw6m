The solution to this problem requires using the Android SDK Manager to install or update the correct version of the build tools.  Expo often requires a specific version. You should check the Expo documentation and community forums to ensure you have the correct version installed.  This is done outside the code itself.  The code below is intended to highlight the problem, not as a direct solution. If the build tools are compatible, the error should resolve.  

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js (Illustrative - Solution lies in managing the Android SDK)
// This file contains no code that directly solves the issue because the issue is not within the javascript code itself but the android environment
console.log('This file demonstrates the project setup.  The actual solution involves using the Android SDK Manager to manage your build tools.')
